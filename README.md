# Maze Solver

I saw a tweet some time ago, That someone had shared a gigantic maze made by himself. I wanted to write a hobby project for some time, so I grabbed the opportunity and wrote a code to solve it for me.

# How to Compile and Run

You need to have `CMake` and `OpenCV v4` installed on your computer.
After that, compile the source codes and run the executable file:

```bash
# Compile
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

# Run
./MazeSolver
```
